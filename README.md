# Automobile Sales Analytics Dashboard

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that provides comprehensive analysis of historical automobile sales data. The dashboard enables users to:

- Analyze yearly automobile sales trends and patterns
- Examine the impact of economic recessions on automobile sales
- Compare performance across different vehicle types
- Understand advertising expenditure distribution
- Study the relationship between unemployment rates and vehicle sales

## Dataset Used

The project utilizes the **Historical Automobile Sales Dataset** obtained from:
`https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/Data%20Files/historical_automobile_sales.csv`

**Dataset Features:**
- **Temporal Data**: Sales records from 1980 to 2023
- **Sales Metrics**: Automobile sales figures with monthly granularity
- **Vehicle Classification**: Data categorized by vehicle types
- **Economic Indicators**: Recession period flags and unemployment rates
- **Marketing Data**: Advertising expenditure by vehicle type
